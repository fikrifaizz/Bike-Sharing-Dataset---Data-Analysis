## Introduction
### Background

        Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return 
    back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return 
    back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of 
    over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, 
    environmental and health issues [1].
        
        Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by
    these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration
    of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into
    a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important
    events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data [1].

### Problem Statement

1. How do holidays affect the total number of bicycle users (cnt)?
2. What is the average and distribution of the number of bicycle users (casual and registered) during peak hours (morning: 7–9, afternoon: 17–19)?
3. Do weather conditions (weathersit) affect the number of bicycle users (cnt)?
4. How does bicycle use (cnt) compare between different seasons?
5. How bicycle usage trends changed from 2011 to 2012?

### Dataset General Information

The dataset consists of 2 main tables:

    1. Daily Data (day.csv): Contains cycling activity information by day with a total of 731 entries and 15 columns.
    2. Hourly Data (hour.csv): Contains information on cycling activity by hour with a total of 17,379 entries and 15 columns.

### Column Description

```
Temporal Column:
    - dteday = Date
    - yr = Year (0: 2011, 1: 2012)
    - mnth = Month (1 - 12)
    - hr = Hours of the day (0-23, hourly data only)
    - weekday = Day of the week (0 for Sunday, 6 for Saturday)

Category Column:
    - season = Season (1: Springer, 2: Summer, 3: Fall, 4: Winter)
    - holiday = Holiday indicator (0: No Holiday, 1: Holiday)
    - workingday = Workingday indicator (0: Not Workingday, 1: Workingday)
    - weathersit = Weather conditions (1: Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy,
