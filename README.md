## Introduction
### Background

        Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return 
    back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return 
    back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of 
    over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, 
    environmental and health issues [1].
        
        Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by
    these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration
    of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into
    a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important
    events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data [1].

### Problem Statement

1. How do holidays affect the total number of bicycle users (cnt)?
2. What is the average and distribution of the number of bicycle users (casual and registered) during peak hours (morning: 7–9, afternoon: 17–19)?
3. Do weather conditions (weathersit) affect the number of bicycle users (cnt)?
4. How does bicycle use (cnt) compare between different seasons?
5. How bicycle usage trends changed from 2011 to 2012?

```
cnt:
    - Highly positively correlated with registered (0.95) and casual (0.67)
    - Positively correlated with temp (0.63) and atemp (0.63)
    - Negative correlation with weathersite (-0.30)

casual:
    - Negative correlation with working day (-0.52)

registered:
    - Positively correlated with working day (0.30)

Correlation Between Weather Variables:
    - temp and atemp have a very strong correlation (0.99), indicating that the actual temperature and perceived temperature are nearly identical.
```
**Hourly Data Correlation**

```
cnt:
    - Highly positively correlated with registered (0.97) and casual (0.69)
    - Positively correlated with temp (0.40) and atemp (0.40)
    - Negative correlation with weathersit (-0.14) and hum (-0.32)

casual:
    - Strong negative correlation with workingday (-0.30)

registered:
    - Positively correlated with working day (0.13)
    - Strongly correlated with hr (Hours) (0.37)

Correlation Between Weather Variables:
    - temp and atemp remain highly correlated (0.99), indicating consistency with daily data.
    - hum (humidity) has a negative correlation with bicycle use, indicating that humid conditions may reduce user interest.

## Discussion, Visualization and Explanatory Data Analysis
### 1. How do holidays affect the total number of bicycle users (cnt)?
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b8710f8-8338-4722-b886-9babe3351abb" alt="Holiday Affect" title="Holiday Affect">

```
1. The average number of bicycle users is higher on non-holiday days (4.527) compared to holidays (3.735).
2. The holiday data only includes 21 records, which is much fewer than non-holidays.
```

### 2. What is the average and distribution of the number of bicycle users (casual and registered) during peak hours (morning: 7–9, afternoon: 17–19)?
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/956b13d6-5d83-47fc-9694-12cfdd914788" alt="Rush Hour Average" title="Rush Hour Average">

```
1. The average number of bicycle users is higher on registered users (290) compare to casual (41)
2. The data shows that each peak hour (morning and evening) recorded the same number of passengers between the two groups.
```

### 3. Do weather conditions (weathersit) affect the number of bicycle users (cnt)?
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/527fbc4d-3c02-4be8-8102-7913d5af9fe8" alt="Weather Condition" title="Weather Condition">

```
1. The worse the weather conditions, the fewer the number of cyclists.
2. Sunny weather is the most supportive condition for bicycle use.
```

### 4. How does bicycle use (cnt) compare between different seasons?
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b68f88f8-b92b-437d-a626-3af145477406" alt="Seasons Compare" title="Seasons Compare">

```
1. Bicycle usage peaks during the summer, making it the most popular season for cycling. Bicycle use decreases drastically during the winter, possibly due to unfavorable weather.
2. Bicycle use is closely related to weather comfort. Warmer and sunnier seasons attract more users.
```

### 5. How bicycle usage trends changed from 2011 to 2012?
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b41552c6-29fb-4cf7-94fd-d313f3a958e5" alt="Monthly Trends" title="Monthly Trends">

```
1. Bicycle use decreases dramatically during the winter (November–February), possibly due to less comfortable weather.
2. September recorded the highest average number of cyclists compared to other months, indicating that late summer or early fall (depending on the dataset location) is the optimal time for cycling.
```

## Conclusion and Recommendation

1. Attract more cyclists on holidays by holding special events or promotions.
2. Allocating more bikes and infrastructure during peak hours can improve the experience of registered users.
3. Provide adequate facilities, such as protected bicycle lanes, to support bicycle use in inclement weather.
4. Consider special promotions to increase bike use in the winter, such as heated bike lanes or discounts.
5. To increase ridership in winter, consider initiatives such as discount offers, special events, or weather-protected bike paths.
